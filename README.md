# Web3RSVP contract

This is the Web3RSVP contract, a smart contract for managing decentralized event RSVPs on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- Secure and transparent: all RSVP operations are recorded on the blockchain and can be verified by anyone.
- Flexible: the contract allows for customization of event parameters, such as the event timestamp, maximum capacity, and deposit amount.
- Easy to use: users can easily RSVP to events and check in at the event using their Ethereum wallet.

## Usage

To use the Web3RSVP contract, you will need an Ethereum wallet and some Ether (ETH) to pay the deposit for the event.

1. First, deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a suitable Ethereum wallet or dApp.
2. Then, users can create new events by sending a transaction to the contract with the required event details.
3. Other users can then RSVP to the event by sending a transaction to the contract with the required deposit amount.
4. At the event, the host can confirm attendees by sending a transaction to the contract with the attendee's address.
5. After the event, the host can pay out the deposits to the confirmed attendees by sending a transaction to the contract.
